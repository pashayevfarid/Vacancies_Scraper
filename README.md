# vacancies_scraper

Vacancies Scraper is a Python-based web scraper I developed to extract job postings from websites. It collects details such as job titles, company names, posted dates, application deadlines, location, salary, required work experience, education level, work type, contract type, contact emails, phone numbers, and job descriptions. The extracted data is saved in a CSV format for easy analysis and further processing.
